## HTTPS and Security Configuration

The Django application has been secured using the following techniques:

### 1. HTTPS Enforcement
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True` ensures all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.
- Nginx is configured with SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.

### 2. Secure Cookies
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS.

### 3. HTTP Headers
- `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY"` blocks clickjacking.
- `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True` prevents MIME-type sniffing.
- `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True` enables browser XSS filter.

### 4. HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- Configured to 1 year with preload and subdomain protection.

### 5. Deployment Notes
- Nginx redirects HTTP to HTTPS and proxies to the Django app on port 8000.
- SSL certificate is configured at `/etc/ssl/certs/your-cert.pem`.

**All settings are located in** `LibraryProject/settings.py`.
